I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the University of California, Irvine. I study machine learning under Professor <a href="https://www.ics.uci.edu/~smyth/">Padhraic Smyth</a>. Prior to joining UCI, I completed my undergraduate degree in mathematics in the Schreyer Honors College at the Pennsylvania State University.



I am broadly interested in probabilistic machine learning. My recent research has focused on uncertainty quantification, data-efficient learning, and applications to collaborative human-AI tasks. My work is supported by an <a href="https://www.ics.uci.edu/hpi/">HPI Fellowship</a>.
